# scopes_and_closures

This assignment is all about namespaces (global, non local and local) and the questions are focused on useing closures. 

There are 4 questions in total. 

Question1 - Write a closure that takes a function and then check whether the function passed has a docstring with more than 50 characters. 50 is stored as a free variable

Question2 - Write a closure that gives you the next Fibonacci number (+ 2 tests) - 100

Question3 - We wrote a closure that counts how many times a function was called. Write a new one that can keep a track of how many times add/mul/div functions were called, and update a global dictionary variable with the counts (+ 6 tests) - 250

Question4 - Modify above such that now we can pass in different dictionary variables to update different dictionaries (+ 6 tests) - 250
